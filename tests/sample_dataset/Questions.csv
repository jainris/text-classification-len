<pre><code>Create Table tRole (
      roleID integer Primary Key
      ,roleName varchar(40)
);
Create Table tFile (
    fileID integer Primary Key
    ,fileName varchar(50)
    ,fileDescription varchar(500)
    ,thumbnailID integer
    ,fileFormatID integer
    ,categoryID integer
    ,isFavorite boolean
    ,dateAdded date
    ,globalAccessCount integer
    ,lastAccessTime date
    ,downloadComplete boolean
    ,isNew boolean
    ,isSpotlight boolean
    ,duration varchar(30)
);
Create Table tCategory (
    categoryID integer Primary Key
    ,categoryName varchar(50)
    ,parent_categoryID integer
);
...
</code></pre>

<p>I execute this in Adobe AIR using the following methods:</p>

<pre><code>public static function RunSqlFromFile(fileName:String):void {
    var file:File = File.applicationDirectory.resolvePath(fileName);
    var stream:FileStream = new FileStream();
    stream.open(file, FileMode.READ)
    var strSql:String = stream.readUTFBytes(stream.bytesAvailable);
    NonQuery(strSql);
}

public static function NonQuery(strSQL:String):void
{
    var sqlConnection:SQLConnection = new SQLConnection();
    sqlConnection.open(File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath(DBPATH);
    var sqlStatement:SQLStatement = new SQLStatement();
    sqlStatement.text = strSQL;
    sqlStatement.sqlConnection = sqlConnection;
    try
    {
        sqlStatement.execute();
    }
    catch (error:SQLError)
    {
        Alert.show(error.toString());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>No errors are generated, however only <code>tRole</code> exists. It seems that it only looks at the first query (up to the semicolon- if I remove it, the query fails). Is there a way to call multiple queries in one statement?</p>

<p>All the better if it's specific to TortoiseSVN client.</p>

<p>I've got the default XML file <code>web.sitemap</code> working properly with my Menu and <strong>SiteMapPath</strong> controls, but I'll need a way for the users of my site to create and modify pages dynamically.</p>

<p>I need to tie page viewing permissions into the standard <code>ASP.NET</code> membership system as well.</p>

The problem is to come up with a way to generate <code>N</code> colors, that are as distinguishable as possible where <code>N</code> is a parameter.</p>

260,91.0,2008-08-01T23:22:08Z,,49,Adding scripting functionality to .NET applications,"<p>I have a little game written in C#. It uses a database as back-end. It's 
a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible_card_game"">trading card game</a>, and I wanted to implement the function of the cards as a script.</p>

<p>What I mean is that I essentially have an interface, <code>ICard</code>, which a card class implements (<code>public class Card056 : ICard</code>) and which contains function that are called by the game.</p>

<p>Now, to make the thing maintainable/moddable, I would like to have the class for each card as source code in the database and essentially compile it on first use. So when I have to add/change a card, I'll just add it to the database and tell my application to refresh, without needing any assembly deployment (especially since we would be talking about 1 assembly per card which means hundreds of assemblies).</p>

<p>Is that possible? Register a class from a source file and then instantiate it, etc.</p>

<pre><code>ICard Cards[current] = new MyGame.CardLibrary.Card056();
Cards[current].OnEnterPlay(ref currentGameState);
</code></pre>

<p>The language is C#, but extra bonus if it's possible to write the script in any .NET language.</p>
